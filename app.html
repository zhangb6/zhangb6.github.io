<h2>Healthcare</h2>
<p>AI may be applied to: surgery robots, imaging and diagnostic systems, hospice care, biometrics and monitoring, mobile care, prosthetics, and beyond.</p>

<h2>Transportation</h2>

<p>In the future, self-navigating and self-operating vehicles might be able to communicate with traffic control centers and other vehicles. And safer, more efficient travel may bring about a public transportation boom in North America.</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>AI is expected to greatly inrease access to education through: remote learning, intelligent tutors, and learning analytics.</p>
<h2>Public Safety</h2>
<p>Experts predict that most North American cities will become heavily dependent on AI by 2030. Applications include:</p>
    <ul><li>Surveillance screening for possible crime or drones</li>
        <li>Predictive policing</li>
        <li>Detecting white collar crime, such as credit card fraud</li>
        <li>Predictably, cybersecurity</li></ul>
<h2>Workplace</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, AI will change the workplace gradually. AI are supposed to replace tasks, not employees--especially since the AI industry is set to generate so many jobs. Ultimately, AI will make conducting business more convenient and virtually barrier-free, encouraging entrepreneurship... or so experts claim.</p>
<h2>Military</h2>
<p>While we may be dreading the creation of AI soldiers in the future, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigDog">Big Dog</a>, the headless pack mule that will accompany accompany soldiers through rough terrain, is our only imminent fear.

<p>By the way, self-directing drones, AI snipers, and bomb disposal robots are already in use<sup><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/in-the-loop-armed-robots-and-the-future-of-war/">5</a></sup>.</p>
