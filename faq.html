<h3>Q. What is artificial intelligence?</h3>
<p>A. Technically, a field of computer science dealing with the contruction of intelligent machines. <i>Fine print:</i>there isn't 100% consensus, even among computer scientists and engineers, about what defines AI. The thing is, once an AI technology has saturated the market, people come to think of it as the new normal, and not as an AI.<sup><a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/node1.html">1</a></sup></p>
<h3>Q. How smart are they <i>really?</i></h3>
<p> A. So AI come in 3 calibers<sup><a href="https://people.rit.edu/~jwt7689/140/proj1/file/ai_evaluation.pdf">2</a></sup>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), aka Weak AI </li>
<p>These AI can only perform a narrow set of designated tasks. They can't develop consciousness or ponder the meaning of life... they just do what their algorithms tells them to do, and spit out the results. It's kind of debatable whether AI at this level are actually "intelligent" (see: <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/chineser/"> Chinese room argument</a>).</p>
<p>Examples: <a href="https://www.google.com/selfdrivingcar/">Google's self-driving car</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)">Deep Blue</a>, friend/product/song recommendations via Facebook, Amazon, Pandora, etc.</p>
<li>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), aka Strong AI</li>
<p>AI at the human level--that is, these AI will be able to perform any intellectual tasks that a human can, and with as much ease. These AI will (theoretically) be self-aware, and have the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, learn quickly, and learn from experience.</p>
<p>Examples: None, yet.</p>
<li>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)</li>
<p>Superintelligent AI that trump human brains in just about every field. Will be wiser, more creative, and even more persuasive than us. Basically, the stuff of sci-fi movies.</p>
<p>Examples: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/">Her</a></p>
</ol>
<h3>Q. You're kidding. You really think they'll be smarter than us one day?</h3>
<p>A. Here's a visual representaiton.</p>

<h3>Q. Fine. So where are we now?</h3>
<p>A. So we've basically conquered ANI, and they're in pretty much everything now. We're just starting in on AGI.</p>
<h3>Q. And how much time do we have before they take over???</h3>
<p> A. Well barriers to creating AGI include: not enough <a href="http://www.singularity.com/charts/page70.html">computational power</a> and an incomplete understanding of how human brains evolved (though experts believe we'll be finding out <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/08/reverse-engineering-brain-kurzweil/">soon</a>). So more or less... like 2060<sup><a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/survey.pdf">3</a></sup>?</p>
<h3>Q. Why is it all happening so fast?</h3>
<p>A. Basically, more advanced societies can progress at a faster rate than less advanced societies, obviously because theyâ€™re more advanced (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change">Law of Accelerating Returns</a>). So watch your back.</p>
